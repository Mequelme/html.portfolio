<h2><p>Matic along with other Scotties Terriers are known for their distinctive appearance, feisty personality, and loyalty. They are a sturdy and independent breed with a lot of character.</p></h2>
  <h3>Here are a few things that influence my decision with getting Scottish Terrier:</h3>
  
  <p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Training: 
      <ul>Start training early and be consistent. Scottish Terriers can be a bit stubborn, but they respond well to positive reinforcement. Basic obedience training will help you establish a strong bond and ensure a well-behaved companion.</ul><br>
   
      <li>Socialization:</li> 
   <ul>
    <li>Introduce your Scottie to various people, environments, and other animals from a young age. This helps prevent shyness or aggressiveness as they grow older.</li>
   </ul> 
  
  Exercise: While they are not overly hyper, Scottish Terriers still need regular exercise to keep them physically and mentally stimulated. Daily walks and playtime in a secure area are essential.
  
  Grooming: Scotties have a distinct double coat that requires regular grooming. Brush their coat at least once a week to prevent matting, and consider professional grooming every few months.
  
  Healthcare: Schedule regular veterinary check-ups and vaccinations. Stay on top of preventative care, such as flea and tick prevention, and be mindful of dental hygiene.
  
  Feeding: Provide a balanced and nutritious diet suitable for your Scottie's age and activity level. Consult your veterinarian to determine the best feeding routine.
  
  Love and Attention: Scottish Terriers thrive on companionship and affection. Spend quality time with your new furry friend, and you'll likely be rewarded with loyalty and devotion.
  
  Remember that every dog is an individual, and your Scottish Terrier will have its own unique personality. Enjoy the journey of building a strong bond with your new canine companion!</p>
